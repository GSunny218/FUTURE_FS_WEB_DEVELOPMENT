                    Today, I embarked on a new project to create a coding learning website. The goal of this website is to provide users with interactive coding lessons, tutorials, and resources to help them learn programming languages such as React, Node.JS, MongoDB and Express.JS. It's a MERN Stack College group project I started by outlining the structure of the website and designing a user-friendly interface. I'm excited to develop this platform and share my knowledge with others who are eager to learn coding.

                    Today, I successfully created my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. I focused on creating a clean and responsive design to ensure a great user experience across different devices. I'm excited to share my work with potential employers and clients through this platform.
